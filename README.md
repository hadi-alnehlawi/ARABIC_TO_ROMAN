# Arabic To Roman Function

## Introduction

This function is an implementation of a code problem to convert numerals from Arabic number to Roman Numeral using the "standard" subtraction notation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals).

The numerals are positive and donâ€™t exceed 3999 in absolute value:

arabic_number: [0..399]

## Run

1. Docker

As a requisite a docker must be installed, you may check if it is existed:

```
$ docker --version
```

The docker will create a persisted image of which might be tagged with a name **arabic_to_roman**.
Running the container as below would be automatically purged after closing

```
$ cd ./ARABIC_TO_ROMAN
$ docker build --tag arabic_to_roman .
$ docker run --rm -ti arabic_to_roman
```

2. Manually

As a perquisite virtualenv package might be installed

`$ virtualenv --version`

If not, please visit this [pypi](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) tutorial for more clarification. Follow the below commands in sequence:

```
$ cd ./ARABIC_TO_ROMAN

$ virtualenv venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

$ python app.py

```

It will prompt to input the arabic number which is required to be converted to Roman numberals. If the input was not valid the function will return the message with error description.

```
$ cd ./ARABIC_TO_ROMAN
